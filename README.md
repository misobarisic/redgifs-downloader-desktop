## QUERYING THE REDGIFS API FOR SEARCH TERMS NO LONGER WORKS

**REDGIFS have changed their API. It no longer supports querying for search terms and getting all gifs from a user.**

This project may be as good as dead with these recent changes.

**Backend npm package is located [here](https://github.com/misobarisic/redgifs-downloader)**
